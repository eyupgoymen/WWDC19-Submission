 # Let's start with a quick definition!

 - Callout(Definition):
    Linked list is a linear data structure that is consisted of several **nodes**. The bottom line of linked list means that each node holds a value and reference of the next node.
 
 Before creating linked list structure, we need to create a node structure. In my journey, each node is going to be a pokeball.
 
 Basically, we are going to hold two things in pokeballs:
  * a pokemon
  * reference of next pokeball
